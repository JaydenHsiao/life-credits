# Life Credits

---

> "For I know the plans I have for you,‚Äù declares the Lord,"plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."

- Jeremiah 29:11

when I look at who I am today, I think of the countless individuals who have shaped my life.
family, friends, teachers, mentors, and strangers - all placed in my life for a reason.
life credits is a place where I can go back to remember my blessings.
to be grateful for the people who I have met.
and to be excited to meet those I have not met yet.
